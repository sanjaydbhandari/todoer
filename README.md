    The description summarizes the functionality and objective of the CLI tool (i.e., managing tasks efficiently).

### 3\. **Options**

-   **Options** are flags that modify the behavior of the command or provide additional information. These are generally preceded by `-` or `--`.

    -   `-V, --version`: This is an option that, when used, outputs the version number of the CLI tool. Both `-V` and `--version` are aliases for this option, so the user can type either one to get the same result.

    Example:

    bash

    Copy code

    `todoer --version`

### 4\. **Commands**

-   **Commands** are specific actions that the user can perform with the CLI tool. Commands often take arguments or options to modify the action.

    Here are the commands listed for the **Todoer** CLI tool:

    -   **`add`**: Adds a new todo task.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer add "Complete homework"`

    -   **`-e <id> <task>`**: This is a shorthand way to edit a todo using the ID of the task and the new task description.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer -e 1 "Complete assignment"`

    -   **`edit`**: Edits an existing todo. (This may take further arguments like ID and new task description, but it's not clear in this output.)

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer edit 1 "Update task"`

    -   **`rm <id>`**: Removes (deletes) a todo by its ID.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer rm 1`

    -   **`del`**: Deletes **all** todos. This is a bulk delete command.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer del`

    -   **`ls`**: Lists all todos.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer ls`

    -   **`list`**: Lists todos using some sort of filter. This command might support various filtering options like incomplete tasks, due dates, etc.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer list --filter incomplete`

    -   **`h`**: This likely shows the available commands. It's a shorthand for help.

        Example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `todoer h`

    -   **`help [command]`**: This command displays help for a specific command.
